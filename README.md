# Welcome to Bootstrapping C#!

And welcome to the world of programming!

This course is composed of modules that cover the basic concepts of C#. Each Module has sequential short lessons, each covering one specific topic. It is not required that you have any prior programming knowledge, but surely it will help a lot if you know something about some programming language.

These are the modules of this course:

- [Module 1](https://github.com/luizparente/CSharp/blob/master/Module%201.md): Covers all the basic concepts of C#, such as variables, data types, console printing and reading, etc.
- [Module 2](https://github.com/luizparente/CSharp/blob/master/Module%202.md): Covers basic flow control methods, such as if, else and switch statements.
- [Module 3](https://github.com/luizparente/CSharp/blob/master/Module%203.md): Covers looping structures, such as do while, while and for loops.
- Module 4: Under development. Will cover the basics of creating functions, methods and classes.

In order to follow this course, it is expected that you have a C# IDE installed in your computer. As a .NET developer, [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) may be your IDE of choice.

In case you need to know something that is not covered in this course, the [official C# documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) is the ideal place for research.
