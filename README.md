# Welcome to Bootstrapping C#!

And welcome to the world of programming!

This course is composed of four Modules that cover the basic concepts of C#. Each Module has sequential short lessons, each covering one specific topic. It is not required that you have any prior programming knowledge, but surely it will help a lot if you know something about some programming language.

These are the modules of this course:

- [Module 1](https://github.com/luizparente/CSharp/blob/master/Module%201.md): Covers all the basic concepts of C#, such as variables, data types, console printing and reading, etc.
- [Module 2](https://github.com/luizparente/CSharp/blob/master/Module%202.md): Covers basic flow control methods, such as If, Else and Switch statements.
- [Module 3](https://github.com/luizparente/CSharp/blob/master/Module%203.md): Covers looping structures, such as Do-While and For loops.
- Module 4: Under development. Will cover the basics of creating functions, methods and classes.

This respository also contains a folder called [CSharp](https://github.com/luizparente/CSharp/tree/master/CSharp), in which all .cs files are stored. That means you have two alternatives to follow along with this course:

- You can follow each Module file, as they contain clear explanations for each written code line, and at the same time you can have your C# IDE open, where you're able to write the code yourself as we go along.

- Alternatively, you can just download the CSharp folder and open them in your C# IDE. The same comments and explanations are there for you to follow.

Ideally, I'd recommend that you stick to the first one, and download the CSharp folder to use it as reference material. The .cs files in this folder also contain exploration exercises for you to put in practice what has been just taught. The subsequential file may contain the solution to those exercises.

In order to follow this course, it is expected that you have a C# IDE installed in your computer. There is no recommended software, as the codes run equally in any C# compiler.

In case you need to know something that is not covered in this course, the [official C# documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) is the ideal place to research.
