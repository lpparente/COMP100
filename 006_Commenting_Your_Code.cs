            Or, in case a block of comments with more than one line is needed, you can do it like this!
            Then you can have multiple lines to write anything that is relevant to your code.
            
            The compiler will ignore these lines, so whatever is written in these blocks will not be displayed to the user!

            This is called DOCUMENTATION. It is very important in professional coding, as programmers usually work in teams.
            Not everyone is able to understand someone else's code in just a glance. So it is a good practice to
            comment and document as much as possible, so that the code can be easily understood by your colleagues.

            Also, your comments may be of great help for yourself in the future! If you ever have to go back to an
            application you coded one or two years ago, chances are you will not be able to remember everything that passed
            through your mind when you first worked in that project. Helpful comment lines can save you hours of screen
            staring and trying to figure out what you did.

            This is one of the most important tools. Comments are available in every programming language.

            Be wise. Use it!
